# Adobe I/O Theme

The Adobe I/O Theme powers all the Adobe `developer.adobe.com` sites to ensure that content is consistent across all the sites.

## Prerequisites

This project uses Yarn 3 to manage package dependencies. If you do not have Yarn 3 installed, follow these instructions:

1. Install [Node.js LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). At the time of writing, the latest LTS version is `v16.15.1`.
2. Install Yarn 3 by running the following command:

   ```bash
   corepack enable
   ```

Corepack is a binary shipped with all Node.js releases starting from 16.10.

3. Update Yarn to the latest version by running the following command:

   ```bash
   yarn set version stable
   ```

4. Make sure you are now using version 3.2.1 of Yarn:.

   ```bash
   yarn --version
   ```

That's it. For more information on Yarn 3 usage, see [Yarn usage](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/usage).

## Theme usage

[Gatsby Themes](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/themes/what-are-gatsby-themes/) allow site functionality to be packaged as a standalone product for others to easily reuse.
Using a theme, all of your default configuration lives in an npm package.

## Getting started

This section will help you get started building a site with the Adobe I/O Theme.

### Using GitHub repository templates

To initialize a site repository, you can use one of the available site templates mentioned above.
Simply click on the “Use this template” button to create a new GitHub repository of the template.

_The templates are pre-configured with example pages._

### Using the Adobe I/O CLI

First install the Adobe I/O CLI via the Terminal

```bash
npm install -g @adobe/aio-cli
```

Then install the Doc Plugin by running.

```bash
aio discover -i
```

Select the `@adobe/aio-cli-plugin-doc` plugin by pressing the _Spacebar_ and finally press _Enter_ to install it.

For more information about the Doc plugin, see https://github.com/adobe/aio-cli-plugin-doc.

Now you can create your site by running

```bash
aio doc init path/to/site/folder
```

which will use by default the [Documentation site template](https://github.com/AdobeDocs/dev-site-documentation-template).

You can specify another template with

```bash
aio doc init path/to/doc/folder --template URL_TO_TEMPLATE_GIT_REPO
```

## Content structure

The content of the site is written in [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) which is both easy to read and easy to learn.

As in most cases, the markdown content is stored in GitHub, we support [GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM)](https://help.github.com/categories/writing-on-github/), which provides additional functionality for common formatting needs.
Additionally, Adobe extended Markdown in a few ways to support certain features see [Writing Enhanced Markdown](#writing-enhanced-markdown).

### Frontmatter

Frontmatter is metadata — at the top of a markdown file — that looks like this:

```yaml
---
title: FAQ—Frequently Asked Questions
description: The FAQ page provides answers to common questions about the configuration and usage of Adobe Analytics in your site.
keywords:
  - Creative Cloud
  - API Documentation
  - UXP
edition: ee
contributor_name: Kalpesh Mehta from Corra
contributor_link: https://partners.magento.com/portal/details/partner/id/70/
layout: none
---
# First heading
```

The `key:value` entries shown in the preceeding example provide your topic with features that include:

- Edition-specific pages for products (such as Commerce vs Open Source)
- Contributor attributions for partners and community members (contributor_name, contributor_link)
- Better search results (title, description, keywords)
- Customizable layouts for pages
- Topic maintainer names and links, and more.

More keywords and value options can be added in future versions as needed.

#### Edition keyword

Adding an `edition` keyword to the frontmatter adds a badge to the top of the page, indicating that the page applies to that product edition. Current values for the `edition` keyword are:

- `ee`: Adobe Commerce only
- `b2b`: B2B feature
- `pwa`: PWA Studio only

For example, adding the `edition` keyword to the frontmatter generates a badge above the page title, as shown here using the `ee` value:

![edition frontmatter keyword](docs/images/edition_keyword_screenshot.png)

#### Contributor name and link keywords

Adding `contributor_name` and `contributor_link` keywords adds a badge to the top of the page, indicating the partner agency or community contributor name with a link to their business or GitHub profile.

For example, adding the `contributor_name` and `contributor_link` keywords to the frontmatter adds an additional badge above the page title:

![attribution frontmatter keyword](docs/images/attribution_keyword_screenshot.png)

### Markdown pages

Make sure the markdown content is located under `src/pages`.

It is recommended to use a folder structure to define your site pages e.g. :

```
root
├- src/pages [/]
│  ├- index.md
│  ├- hero.png
│  ├- api [/api/]
│  │  └- index.md
│  └- guides [/guides/]
│      ├─ index.md
│      └- get_started [/guides/get_started/]
│        ├- index.md
│        └- debugging [/guides/get_started/debugging/]
│           └- index.md
├- .env
├─ gatsby-config.js
└─ package.json
```

Using a folder structure with only `index.md` files gets you close to the final site build files. During the build process, `md` files will be transformed into `index.html` files.
The build files can be found in the `public` folder. Please read the [Overview of the Build Process](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/overview-of-the-gatsby-build-process/) for more information.

Here's a simple example of a content structure with `md` files and the resulting `html` files:

```
root
├- src/pages [/]
│  ├- index.md
│  ├- i_follow_recommendation [/i_follow_recommendation/]
│  │  └- index.md
│  └- i_dont_follow_recommendation.md [/i_dont_follow_recommendation/]
├- .env
├─ gatsby-config.js
└─ package.json
```

will output:

```
root
└- public
   ├- index.html
   ├- i_follow_recommendation
   │  └- index.html
   ├- i_dont_follow_recommendation
   │  └- index.html
   └- Minified JS, CSS files
```

You can exclude pages from the build by either moving them out of `src/pages` or by prefixing the filename with `_`.

### Links

#### Internal links

Using markdown links to link to pages e.g. :

_Relative link_

```
[Link to mypage](../mypage.md)
```

_Absolute link_

```
[Link to mypage](/src/pages/mypage.md)
```

Add the suffix `#` to a link to jump to a section of the page for example if your page has a heading named `Join the future`, you can link to it:

```
[Link to mypage](../mypage.md#join-the-future)
```

You can also use absolute links or relative links to link between markdown pages e.g. with the example folder structure from [Content Structure](#content-structure) you can add a link from `/guides/index.md` to `/api/index.md` with:

_Relative link_

```
[Link to API](../api/)
```

_Absolute link_

```
[Link to API](/api/)
```

**Please note that currently only absolute links will work with transcluded content.**

#### External links

External links will automatically open in a new tab or window.

```
[Link to example.com](https://example.com)
```

You can prevent this behavior by adding the search parameter `?aio_internal` to the link.

### Assets

Images can be placed next to markdown pages inside `src/pages` and referenced using relative links. In this case, they'll be optimized during the build process and resulting file names are hashed to resolve potential caching issues.

Other asset types (e.g. PDFs etc.) can be placed inside a `static` folder at the root. Those assets are not being processed but simply copied into the `public` folder.

Here's a simple example of a content structure with a markdown page file and 2 different asset types:

```
root
├- src/pages [/]
│  ├- index.md
│  └- image.png
├- static [/]
│  └- document.pdf
├─ gatsby-config.js
└─ package.json
```

where `image.png` is referenced in `index.md` as an image:

```
![alt image](./image.png)
```

and `document.pdf` is referenced in `index.md` as a link:

```
[document](/document.pdf)
```

You'll find more information about the `static` folder at [Using the Static Folder](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/how-to/images-and-media/static-folder/).

Please find guidance on ideal illustration sizes in this [document](docs/documents/MCS_Media_+_Image_Recommendations.pdf).

## Configuration

To make sure you don't run into troubles during the site build process, please follow the below configuration steps.

### Environment variables

Follow these steps to configure your `.env` file.

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
2. Add the appropriate values in the `.env` file

**The .env should not be committed.**

#### GitHub Contributors

GitHub's API is being called during the site build phase to retrieve the authors of every markdown page under `src/pages`.
If the GitHub Token information is missing, the build will just print a warning, and no contributor information will be retrieved (just the contributor information in a page's front matter, if any, will be used).

To retrieve your GitHub personal access token, you can follow these [steps](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token).
Only `READ` permissions on repositories are required for the token.
For example, if your doc site repo was at https://github.com/adobe/aio-theme using the `main` branch, this would be what your `.env` would look like:

```properties
REPO_GITHUB_TOKEN=YOUR_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN_HERE
REPO_OWNER=adobe
REPO_NAME=aio-theme
REPO_BRANCH=main
REPO_ROOT=example
```

By default, you can omit the `ROOT` env var, and it should use the root folder as the source of the documentation pages. If your site is in a sub-folder, add the relative path as the `ROOT`.

#### Analytics and Feedback component

- You need to set up [Adobe Launch](https://launch.adobe.com), with an Adobe Analytics Reporting Suite
- In Adobe Analytics, add a custom eVar (Text String type) to capture the feedback. This eVar will contain either "yes" or "no".
- In Adobe Launch, create two Data Elements:
  1. Feedback-Yes: edit the code and paste in `return document.querySelectorAll('button.feedback-yes')[0].innerText`
  2. Feedback-No: edit the code and paste in `return document.querySelectorAll('button.feedback-no')[0].innerText`
- In Adobe Launch, for the two Data Elements, make sure these checkboxes are checked:
  1. Enable Default Value
  2. Force lowercase value
  3. Clean text
- In Adobe Launch, create three Rules:
  1. Feedback-Yes: On click, it will set variables in Adobe Analytics (set the custom eVar to value of the Feedback-Yes Data Element), and then Send the Beacon
  2. Feedback-No: On click, it will set variables in Adobe Analytics (set the custom eVar to the value of the Feedback-No Data Element), and then Send the Beacon
  3. Analytics: On library loaded (page top), Send the Beacon
- In Adobe Launch:
  1. Go through the `Publishing Flow`, don't forget to `Add All Resources`
  2. In `Environments`, select the appropriate environment, and under the `Install` column, select the icon
  3. Copy the url displayed in the `script` tag

This last value will be the value you put in `GATSBY_ADOBE_LAUNCH_SRC`.

```properties
GATSBY_ADOBE_LAUNCH_SRC=https://your.adobe.launch.url.here
```

#### Identity Management Services

To enable IMS on the browser side, you'll need to set following env variables:

- `GATSBY_IMS_CONFIG` - Map of `client_id` and `scopes` etc.
- `GATSBY_IMS_SRC` - URL source of IMS library

## Algolia indexing and search

Sites hosted on the `developer.adobe.com` domain can now add Algolia search to help users find content fast.
There are two parts to adding the Algolia search feature to your site:

1. Add server-side environment variables to create and publish your site's content to Algolia's servers. This is an admin-only feature. Consult your site administrator for more details.
2. Add client-side environment variables to search your content on Algolia's servers and return content matches (with links) to users.

### Server-side environment variables

**Admin Only.** To publish your site's content to Algolia so it's searchable, add the following variables to your site's `.env` file:

- `ALGOLIA_INDEXATION_MODE` — `[skip | console | index]`
  - `skip` mode - skip running of search indexation (default)
  - `console` mode - index data will be published to console, but not pushed to real search index
  - `index` mode - index data will be pushed to real search index
- `ALGOLIA_WRITE_API_KEY` - Alpha-numeric string required to write index files to Algolia's servers. You should never commit this key to GitHub.
- `GATSBY_ALGOLIA_APP_ID` - Alpha-numeric string required to access Adobe's documentation indexes.
- `ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME` - The name of the Algolia index where the site's content will be published. If you don't add this variable (or if you leave it blank), your site's index is auto-generated using the name of your repo. If you need to publish the site's content to another site's index (creating a shared index), add the name of the other site's index here.

### Client-side (browser) environment variables

To enable search on the browser side, you'll need to set the following variables in your site's `.env` file:

- `GATSBY_ALGOLIA_APP_ID` - Alpha-numeric string required to access Adobe's documentation indexes.
- `GATSBY_ALGOLIA_API_KEY` - Alpha-numeric string required to search indexes on Algolia servers.
- `GATSBY_ALGOLIA_INDEX_ALL` - List of all indexes to search e.g. `["index1", "index2"]`
- `GATSBY_ALGOLIA_SEARCH_INDEX` - Map of individual indexes with labels to perform search operations `[{"index1": "Index 1"}, {"all": "All Results"}]`. Use `all` to indicate that all indexes should be searched.

## Global Navigation

The Global navigation links are configurable in `gatsby-config.js` under `pages`.
If you follow the recommended [content structure](#content-structure), you can define the `path` value using the folder names.

For example, the following folder structure maps to the URL defined in brackets:

```
src/pages [/]
├- index.md
├- api [/api/]
│  └- index.md
└- guides [/guides/]
   └─ index.md
```

then define your Global Navigation using `pages` in `gatsby-config.js`:

```
pages: [
  {
    title: 'Adobe Analytics',
    path: '/'
  },
  {
    title: 'Guides',
    path: '/guides/'
  },
  {
    title: 'API Reference',
    path: '/api/'
  }
]
```

You can also define it by pointing to the markdown files:

```
pages: [
  {
    title: 'Adobe Analytics',
    path: 'index.md'
  },
  {
    title: 'Guides',
    path: 'guides.md'
  },
  {
    title: 'API Reference',
    path: 'api.md'
  }
]
```

Search `?foo=bar` and hash `#foo` values are also supported.

The order in which the pages are defined is respected in the Global Navigation.

If the current location corresponds to a `path` defined under `pages`, the correspond tab in the Global Navigation is set as active.
Otherwise, the first defined tab is set as active by default.

**At least one defined page is required. It's recommended to define the first page `path` as the root path `/`.**

## Menus

You can group links inside a dropdown menu in the Global Navigation with the `menu` field.
Optionally, you can set a description to better differentiate grouped links e.g. based on the previous example:

```
pages: [
  {
    title: 'Adobe Analytics',
    path: 'index.md'
  },
  {
    title: 'Guides',
    path: 'guides.md'
  },
  {
    title: 'API Reference',
    menu: [{
      title: 'v2.0'
      description: 'Version 2.0 of API' // optional,
      path: '2.0/api.index'
    }, {
     title: 'v1.4'
     description: 'Version 2.0 of API' // optional,
     path: '1.4/api.index'
   }]
  }
]
```

## Home link

The home link should be used to inform the user about a parent or sibling site external to the current one.
Breadcrumbs will be displayed automatically to help the user understand its current location.

You can define a home link in `gatsby-config.js` for instance:

```
home: {
  title: 'Photoshop',
  path: 'https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html'
}
```

A default home link is displayed if none provided. If you don't want to display any home link, set `hidden` to `true`:

```
home: {
  hidden: true
}
```

## Side Navigation

The Side navigation links are configurable in `gatsby-config.js` under `subPages`.
You have to create a directory hierarchy which will be represented literally in the URL so that any sub page `path` starts with a `path` from `pages`.

For example, the following folder structure maps to the URL defined in brackets:

```
src/pages [/]
├- index.md
├- api [/api/]
│  └- index.md
└- guides [/guides/]
   ├─ index.md
   └- get_started [/guides/get_started/]
      ├- index.md
      └- debugging [/guides/get_started/debugging/]
         └- index.md
```

then define your Side Navigation for `/guides/` using `subPages` in `gatsby-config.js`:

```
pages: [
  {
    title: 'Adobe Analytics',
    path: '/'
  },
  {
    title: 'Guides',
    path: '/guides/'
  },
  {
    title: 'API Reference',
    path: '/api/'
  }
],
subPages: [
  {
    title: 'Get Started',
    path: '/guides/get_started',
    pages: [
      {
        title: 'Debugging',
        path: '/guides/get_started/debugging/'
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

Similarly to the Global Navigation:

- The order in which the sub pages are defined is respected in the Side Navigation.
- Setting search and hash values in the path is supported
- Linking markdown files is supported

**Important: All sub pages paths have to be children of a top-level navigation path.**

### Variations

There are 3 variations of the Side Navigation:

1. Single-level side navigation
2. Categorical single-level side navigation
3. Multi-level side navigation

Please refer to the section [use the right variation](#use-the-right-variation) to understand which side navigation variation to use.

#### Single-level side navigation

To create a single-level side navigation, you shouldn't specify `pages` for `subPages` for example:

![single-level side navigation](docs/images/single-level-sidenav.png)

is matching to the following config:

```
pages: [
  {
    title: 'Support',
    path: '/support/'
  }
],
subPages: [
  {
    title: 'Help',
    path: '/support/'
  },
  {
    title: 'How to contribute',
    path: '/support/contribute/'
  },
  {
    title: 'FAQ',
    path: '/support/FAQ/'
  },
  {
    title: 'Community',
    path: '/support/community/'
  }
]
```

#### Single-level side navigation with headers

To create a single-level side navigation with headers, you should set `header: true` on top-level `subPages` and follow the [auto-collapsing](#auto-collapsing-of-multi-level-side-navigation) rules for example:

![single-level side navigation with headers](docs/images/single-level-sidenav-with-header.png)

is matching the following config:

```
pages: [
  {
    title: 'Support',
    path: '/support/'
  }
],
subPages: [
  {
    title: 'Overview',
    path: '/support/',
    header: true,
    pages: [
      {
        title: 'Help',
        path: '/support/'
      },
      {
        title: 'FAQ',
        path: '/support/FAQ/'
      },
      {
        title: 'How to contribute',
        path: '/support/contribute/'
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    title: 'Community',
    path: '/support/community/',
    header: true,
    pages: [
      {
        title: 'Information',
        path: '/support/community/'
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

#### Multi-level side navigation

To create a multi-level side navigation, you have to define `pages` for `subPages` for example:

![multi-level side navigation](docs/images/multi-level-sidenav.png)

is matching the following config:

```
pages: [
  {
    title: 'Support',
    path: '/support/'
  }
],
subPages: [
  {
    title: 'Overview',
    path: '/support/',
    pages: [
      {
        title: 'Help',
        path: '/support/'
      },
      {
        title: 'FAQ',
        path: '/support/FAQ/'
      },
      {
        title: 'How to contribute',
        path: '/support/contribute/'
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    title: 'Community',
    path: '/support/community/',
    pages: [
      {
        title: 'Information',
        path: '/support/community/'
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

#### Auto-collapsing of multi-level side navigation

In the previous multi-level side navigation example, if the current location is `/support/`, `Overview` auto-collapses and selects `Help` by default because `Overview` and `Help` paths both matches the current location `/support/`.

It also means that if you don't want the auto-collapsing behavior, you have to define different paths for `subPages` than you defined for `pages` e.g. for the previous example, to avoid auto-collapsing of `Overview`,
you would have to define a different path for `Overview` and `Help`:

```
pages: [
  {
    title: 'Support',
    path: '/support/'
  }
],
subPages: [
  {
    title: 'Overview',
    path: '/support/overview/',
    pages: [
      {
        title: 'Help',
        path: '/support/overview/help/'
      },
      {
        title: 'FAQ',
        path: '/support/overview/FAQ/'
      },
      {
        title: 'How to contribute',
        path: '/support/overview/contribute/'
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    title: 'Community',
    path: '/support/community/',
    pages: [
      {
        title: 'Information',
        path: '/support/community/'
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

which will render:

#### Use descriptive titles

Navigation should be helpful. Choose titles for navigation items that clearly represent the surfaces where they'll go. Avoid using titles that are arbitrary or un-useful, since this can pose usability issues for your product.

#### Be concise

Along with being descriptive, navigation items should be succinct. Reduce any unnecessary words in order to ensure simplicity. Navigation items should never be so long that they require truncation, except in instances where navigation is user-generated.

#### Use sentence case

Navigation items should be written in sentence case.

#### Use the right variation

Make sure that you are using the right variation for your products’ context and users’ needs. Don’t mix behavior, styles, or variations together in a single navigation menu:

- When navigation is simple, use the single-level side navigation.
- When navigation is simple but categorical, use the single-level side navigation with headers.
- When navigation is expansive, hierarchical, and/or you need progressive disclosure in your menu behavior, use the multi-level side navigation.

#### Avoid deep nested menus

The multi-level side navigation should only go 3 levels deep. More than 3 levels will make the indentation indiscernible, which can become a major usability issue in your product.

#### Use consistent multi-level behavior

If top-level navigation items have a location associated with them, send the user to that location and open the sub-level navigation items. If a top-level navigation item does not have any associated location, only open the sub-level navigation items.

Side navigation can use either of these behaviors, but should never mix behaviors in the same experience.

## Versions

You can specify multiple versions for your site in `gatsby-config.js` under `versions`.
The first entry is the selected version by default.

```
versions: [
  {
    title: 'v2.0',
    selected: true
  },
  {
    title: 'v1.4',
    path: 'https://github.com/AdobeDocs/analytics-1.4-apis'
  }
],
```

**Important: managing multiple versions inside a single repository is not supported.**

## Building the site

You can generate a production version of the site using following commands:

With the CLI:

```bash
aio doc generate
```

Or run following commands:

- To build and preview a production version of the site: `npm run start`.
- To build and preview a production version of the site with path prefix: `npm run start:prefix`.
- To build and preview a development version of the site with hot reloading: `npm run dev`.

### Adding a Path Prefix

Many applications are hosted at something other than the root (`/`) of their domain.
For example, a blog could live at `example.com/blog/`, or a site could be hosted on GitHub Pages at `example.github.io/my-site/`.

To add a Path Prefix, go to your `gatsby-config.js` file and specify the prefix with:

```
pathPrefix: process.env.PATH_PREFIX || '/MY_PREFIX/'
```

## Deploying the site

### Preview on GitHub Pages

To enable GitHub Pages, go to your repository settings under the GitHub Pages section, select the `gh-pages` branch as source and press Save. Your site will be available for preview at https://ORG_NAME.github.io/REPO_NAME.

On every commit to the `main` branch, the site will be built to GitHub Pages automatically, for you to preview as a development version. This is the default branch for new repos in GitHub.

`GitHub Contributors component`: this will use the GitHub token automatically provided by the GitHub Action to retrieve data

`Feedback component`: no environmental variable should be set since GitHub Pages should only be for development purposes

### Deploy to Azure Storage Static Websites

You can manually trigger the deploy workflow by pressing the **Run workflow** button:

1. Go to your repository actions overview page i.e. https://github.com/ORG/REPOSITORY/actions
2. Click on the "Deploy" workflow
3. Press **Run workflow**. You can choose which branch the workflow is run on and specify the deployment type (`dev` for development or/and `prod` for production).

Using the `Clean cache`: typically you won't have to set this to `yes`. The most common scenario of when to use is when you do a deploy and a particular resource isn't updating to the most recent change. eg, a static image is still on the old version. Try setting this to `yes` and redeploy the site.

Using the `Exclude a subfolder from deletion`: folders listed here separated out by commas will exclude them from being overwritten when doing a deploy. This is useful if you have multiple sites deploying to the same path. eg, one repo deploys to `/photoshop/` and another repo deploys to `/photoshop/docs/`. You can set the the repo that deploys to `/photoshop/` option as `Exclude a subfolder from deletion`: `docs`. Then whenever that `/photoshop/` repo deploys, the subfolder `docs` will not get deleted. You can also list out multiple subfolders separated by commas like so: `api, photoshop-api-docs, uxp, another-path` etc.

**Pre-requisites:**

1. Setting your `PATH_PREFIX` as explained [here](#adding-a-path-prefix). This is the sub-folder to deploy this micro-site to.

- For example, if you want to deploy to `https://example.com/foo/bar`, you must set `PATH_PREFIX` to `/foo/bar/`
- For sites deployed to the `root`, use `/` as the `PATH_PREFIX`

2. The person initiating the deploy workflow must have `write` access to the repository.

## Writing Enhanced Markdown

### Metadata with Front matter

Front matter allows an author to specify metadata for a page. For example, you can define the page meta title and description by adding front matter to the beginning of your markdown file:

<pre>
---
title: Guides - Adobe Analytics
description: This is the guides overview page of Adobe Analytics
---
</pre>

In addition to the GitHub contributors of a markdown file, you can specify external contributors with front matter.
They'll show up first before the GitHub contributors.

<pre>
---
contributors:
- https://github.com/simonwex
---
</pre>
  
You can also specify whether or not to hide breadcrumb navigation on pages without a hero at the top.  Pages with a Hero can flag the breadcrumb option on the Hero component if needed.
<pre>
---
title: Guides - Adobe Analytics
description: This is the guides overview page of Adobe Analytics without a breadcrumb
contributors:
  - https://github.com/simonwex
  - https://github.com/davidbenge
hideBreadcrumbNav: false 
---
</pre>

### OpenAPI

We use [Redoc](https://github.com/Redocly/redoc) to render OpenAPI specs. Simply use front matter to define the spec URL.

<pre>

## openAPISpec: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AdobeDocs/analytics-2.0-apis/master/docs/swagger.json

</pre>

### JSDoc

We currently recommend to use the [JSDoc to markdown](https://github.com/jsdoc2md/jsdoc-to-markdown) converter.

Use front matter to specify a JSDoc markdown document.

<pre>

## jsDoc: true

</pre>

Then annotate your JS parameters with `<JsDocParameters/>` to render them nicely see the [example markdown file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adobe/aio-theme/main/example/src/pages/jsdoc/index.md).

### MDX

[MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) is supported out of the box. MDX enables writing [JSX React components](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html) in markdown giving authors new powers.
Despite the markdown files having all an `md` extension, they are actually treated as MDX files. You can use `md` and `mdx` extensions interchangeably.

As we try to limit the use of MDX in favor of pure markdown, we have come up with a way to couple the use of basic markdown syntax with JSX.

**Always make sure to close JSX blocks and use line breaks between JSX blocks and markdown content to avoid MDX parser issues.**

### Modular Content System

The modular content system is a set of content blocks with variants and compositions that can be used to create pages.

- **Content Blocks are goal-focused.** A group of content that has a specific goal or intention, to structure and support the overall narrative.
  _Examples are groupings of text, groupings of buttons, and hero content._

- **Variants are messaging-focused.** The messaging points/content (this includes both written and visual content/images) that makes the goal of the content block happen.
  _Examples are text content blocks with icons vs no icons._

- **Compositions are layout-focused.** The overall narrative for the page.

**A variant can go into a _content block_. Multiple _content blocks_ make up a _composition_.**

### JSX Blocks

**The Content Blocks are defined as JSX Blocks.** They use a `slots` property to identify which markdown elements to ingest using only string properties.
This helps maintain better readability when rendered on https://github.com.

Common slots are: `heading`, `image` and `text`. See below examples for full details.

### Hero Block

A Hero Block should be used on every home page. **Only 1 Hero Block per page is allowed**.
They are used to set up the tone of the page and optionally add call to actions and intentions for users.

There are 3 different variants:

- The default variant for Documentation pages.
- The half width variant for Product/Platform authored pages.
- The full width variant for Index home pages.

**Default variant:**

![hero default](docs/images/hero-default.png)

```
<Hero slots="image, heading, text" background="rgb(64, 34, 138)" hideBreadcrumbNav={false}/>

![Hero image](./illustration.png)

### InlineAlert block (Updated: 2022-06-08)

The Inline Alert block provides ways to highlight various types of information, using an optional title, text blocks,
and variants.

#### Anatomy of an InlineAlert block

```markdown
<InlineAlert variant="[value]" slots="title, text1, text2, text[n]" />
```

**Variant values**

As shown above, the first property of an InlineAlert is the `variant` property. The value of this property determines
the icon and border color of the alert. The `variant` values you can use are described here:

- `info` (default) — use to add helpful information.
- `help` — use to add brief steps from or links to other help topics.
- `error` — use to highlight errors that may result from an action.
- `success` — use to highlight success messages that may be displayed after an action.
- `warning` — use to focus attention on a potential problem that could occur.
- `neutral` — use as an all-purpose callout that displays a black border and no icon.

![inline alert](docs/images/inline-alert-variants.png)

The slots and variants of an InlineAlert block are as follows.

**Slot values**

Use the following slots to style your markdown text within the InlineAlert block:

- `title` (optional) — Use plain markdown text. The slot will bold the title and space it above your text appropriately.
  You can only use one title per alert block.
- `text` (required). Use plain markdown text.
- `text2`...`text[n]` (optional) - You can use additional text slots to display multiple paragraphs. Just make sure each
  additional text block starts with the word `text` followed by numbers or letters that make each text slot unique.

#### Simple InlineAlert

The simplest `InlineAlert` you can create uses a single `text` slot, as shown here:

```markdown
<InlineAlert slots="text" />

This is the text that displays within the default alert variant — info.
```

![inline alert](docs/images/inline-alert.png)

#### Richer InlineAlert

To add an InlineAlert with a different variant, a title, and multiple paragraphs, you can specify all the optional
properties, as shown here:

```markdown
<InlineAlert variant="help" slots="header, text1, text2, text3, text4" />

Alternative steps:

**Step 1:** This is faux step text for the `text1` slot.
This is faux step text for the `text1` slot.
This is faux step text for the `text1` slot.
This is faux step text for the `text1` slot.
This is faux step text for the `text1` slot.

**Step 2:** This is faux step text for the `text2` slot.
This is faux step text for the `text2` slot.
This is faux step text for the `text2` slot.

**Step 3:** This is faux step text for the `text3` slot.

**Step 4:** This is faux step text for the `text4` slot.
This is faux step text for the `text3` slot.
```

```

Use `slots` to identify the markdown content:

- `heading` (required)
- `text` (required)
- `buttons` (1 button required at least)
- `icon` (optional)

Use `theme` to match the text color to your color scheme. Defaults to `lightest`.

Use `width` to define the size of the block. Supported values are `100%`, `50%`, `33%` and `25%`;

### Product Card Grid

Use Product Card Grid to display Product Cards with filter and sort options based on meta data.

![product card grid](docs/images/product-card-grid.png)

Set `interaction` to `true` to display the filter and sort options.

See the [data example](https://github.com/adobe/aio-theme/blob/main/example/src/products/index.js) to provide for `clouds` and `products`.

```

<ProductCardGrid clouds={clouds} products={products} interaction={true} />
```

Use `orderBy` to define the default ordering. Choose between `last_updated` and `name`.

Use `filterByCloud` to define the default cloud filter. You can define multiple clouds by default `filterByCloud={[cloud1, cloud2]}`.

Use `filterByIds` to define a custom filter e.g. `filterByIds=[1, 3, 4]` to display products with ids `1`, `3` and `4` in that order.

### Resource Card

Resource Cards are used on Product/Platform pages for external cross-promotion of materials. Examples includes articles, videos etc.

There are 2 variants: horizontal and vertical Resource Cards. Use multiple Resource Cards with different variants to create a Resource composition.

Use `slots` to identify the markdown content:

- `image` (required)
- `heading` (optional)
- `text` (required)
- `buttons`(optional)

Use `theme` to match the text color to your color scheme. Defaults to `dark`.

Use `repeat` to define how many code sections are part of the carousel.

### Edition

The Edition component is used to display the edition of the product.

### Embedding markdown documents and filtering content

You can use MDX transclusion to embed markdown documents into other markdown documents see the [MDX documentation](https://mdxjs.com/getting-started#documents).

#### Embedding local markdown files

For example, if you want to include the content of `overview.md` into `index.md`:

`index.md` content:

```
import Overview from './overview.md'

# Welcome

Lorem ipsum

<Overview/>

## Questions

Lorem ipsum
```

`overview.md` content:

```
## Overview

Lorem ipsum
```

`index.md` will be rendered as:

```
# Welcome

Lorem ipsum

## Overview

Lorem ipsum

## Questions

Lorem ipsum
```

#### Embedding external markdown files

Sites are using `npm` to define dependencies so we can also include external markdown documents.

**You have to define a name in the `package.json` like [here](https://github.com/AdobeDocs/dev-site-documentation-template/blob/main/package.json#L3) to be able to include it
as a dependency in another site.**

You don't have to release the site on npm since npm supports installing dependencies using github repository urls. For example, to install https://github.com/AdobeDocs/dev-site-documentation-template/
as a dependency in another site, you can run the command `npm install --save adobedocs/dev-site-documentation-template`;

Your site package will show up under `node_modules/[PACKAGE_NAME]` e.g. `node_modules/dev-site-documentation-template`.

See full example below using a Variant block.

#### Filtering content with Variant Blocks

Together with Variant Blocks, the author can query what should be rendered from external sources.

**This allows to write content once, and reuse it everywhere.**

For example, let's say there are 2 repositories named http://github.com/adobedocs/repo1 and http://github.com/adobedocs/repo2.
Both are sites using the theme and have markdown content defined under `src/pages`.

1. repo1 has reusable markdown content written with Variant Blocks under `/src/pages/debugging/index.md`:

```

<Variant product="XD" repeat="2" />

First launch the XD console, by clicking Developer > Console

[XD link](https://adobe.io)

<Variant product="Photoshop" repeat="2" />

First launch the Photoshop console, by clicking Developer > Console

[Photoshop link](https://adobe.io)

<Variant test="image" repeat="2" />

#### Image

![image](../test/image.png)
```

_Use `repeat` to define how many elements are part of the Variant Block. Use any `key=value` property to mark your Variant Block._

2. repo2 added repo1 as dependency with `npm install --save adobedocs/repo1` to be able to reference its markdown content.

3. repo2 embeds repo1 content by using the `import` statement and inserts the content in its own markdown together with a `query` filter to only display what is needed.

```
import Debugging from 'repo1/src/pages/debugging/index.md'

# Debugging

<Debugging query="product=Photoshop" />

More content
```

will be rendered as:

```
# Debugging

```

## Customizations

When using themes, you can take advantage of something called [shadowing](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/themes/shadowing/). This allows you to override the default component included in the theme with a custom one you’ve created.

The Adobe I/O Theme package has a component to render code using the [Prism syntax highlighter](https://prismjs.com/).
With shadowing, you can override the component to provide your own.

If you look at the file tree of your site, you’ll see it looks something like this:

```
root
├─ src/pages
│   ├- index.md
│   └- etc.
├- .env
├─ gatsby-config.js
└─ package.json
```

To enable shadowing, you need to add a folder called `@adobe/gatsby-theme-aio`.
Any file placed in that directory with a path that matches the path of a file from the theme will completely shadow the file.

So the new folder structure with shadowing enabled will look like following:

```
root
├─ src
│  ├- pages
│  │  ├- index.md
│  │  └- etc.
│  └- @adobe
│     └- gatsby-theme-aio
│        └- components
│           └- Code
│              └- index.js
├- .env
├─ gatsby-config.js
└─ package.json
```

You can define your own `Code` components under `src/@adobe/gatsby-theme-aio/components/Code/index.js`.

_Notice omitting the `src` directory in the shadow folder._

### Custom layout

You can build pages without the default layout by setting `layout` to `none` within the page front matter.
The Global Header, Footer, Side Navigation etc. are always shown but anything in between can be customized.

See the [example markdown file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adobe/aio-theme/main/example/src/pages/no_layout/index.md).

### Frame

This can be useful if you want to embed pages from another system. The embedded page will be framed between the Global Header and Footer.
Simply set `frameSrc` to the `url` of the external page within the front matter.

See the [example parent page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adobe/aio-theme/main/example/src/pages/frame.md) and [child page](https://github.com/adobe/aio-theme/blob/main/example/static/child.html) which leverages the [Penpal](https://github.com/Aaronius/penpal)
library to create a communication channel to exchange information.

### Theming

Currently, you can only define a light or dark theme for Code blocks. By default, Code blocks are displayed in `dark` theme.
To change Code blocks from `dark` to `light` theme, you have to shadow the `theme/index.js` file:

```
export default {
  code: 'light'
};
```

## Upgrading

### Locally

To upgrade to the latest version of the theme, simply run `npm update` if you have defined the dependency with a version range selector.
If not, update the version of the dependency by setting the version manually in the `package.json` and run `npm install`.

This will also update the lock file `package-lock.json`.

### Automated

We recommend to setup [GitHub dependabot](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/administering-a-repository/keeping-your-dependencies-updated-automatically) in your site repository.
Simply copy the [dependabot](https://github.com/AdobeDocs/dev-site-documentation-template/blob/main/.github/dependabot.yml) file in your `.github` folder.

The bot will automatically submit pull requests to keep your version of the theme up to date. Please make sure to use a version range selector for your dependencies in your `package.json`.
