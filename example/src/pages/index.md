## Inline Alerts

These are the five types of inline alerts you can use.

<InlineAlert slots="text"/>

This is the text that displays within the default alert variant — info.

<InlineAlert variant="neutral" slots="text" />

This is an inline alert with the variant `neutral`.

<InlineAlert variant="info" slots="text" />

This is an inline alert with the variant `info`.

<InlineAlert variant="help" slots="text" />

This is an inline alert with the variant `help`.

<InlineAlert variant="success" slots="text" />

This is an inline alert with the variant `success`.

<InlineAlert variant="warning" slots="text" />

This is an inline alert with the variant `warning`.

<InlineAlert variant="error" slots="text" />

This is an inline alert with the variant `error`.

<InlineAlert variant="success" slots="header, text" />

InlineAlert components can have header text.

And InlineAlert components can have body text like this.

<InlineAlert variant="help" slots="header, text1, text2, text3, text4" />

Multiple paragraphs!!

The number of paragraphs is technically unlimited for flexibility.

But you know the drill. *Discretion is key.*

This is your **third paragraph**.

This is your ~~last~~ fourth paragraph. You can make each paragraph as long as you want.
As long as you don't create an empty line in between your text blocks.

<InlineAlert variant="warning" slots="header, text-10, text-1, text-doesnt-matter-just-start-with-text-and-make-it-unique" />

Important "text slot" details

This is the first text slot, but its slot name is `text-10`.

This is the second text slot, but its slot name is `text-1`.

So the only requirements for naming your text slots — **only within the InlineAlert component for now** — is to start
them with `text` and make them unique from the other text slots in the alert. For example, this is a valid slot
name: `text-doesnt-matter-just-start-with-text-and-make-it-unique`.

<InlineAlert variant="help" slots="header, text1, text2, text3, text4" />

Alternative steps:

**Step 1:** This is faux step text for the `text1` slot. This is faux step text for the `text1` slot. This is faux step
text for the `text1` slot. This is faux step text for the `text1` slot. This is faux step text for the `text1` slot.

**Step 2:** This is faux step text for the `text2` slot. This is faux step text for the `text2` slot. This is faux step
text for the `text2` slot.

**Step 3:** This is faux step text for the `text3` slot.

**Step 4:** This is faux step text for the `text4` slot. This is faux step text for the `text3` slot.

<InlineAlert variant="error" slots="header, text, text2, text1" />

This is an error!

This is an inline alert with the variant `error`. This is an inline alert with the variant `error`. This is an inline alert with the variant `error`. This is an inline alert with the variant `error`. This is an inline alert with the variant `error`. This is an inline alert with the variant `error`.

**This is currently the best way to add a code block to an InlineAlert:**

`warn Warning: Event "xstate.after(200)#waitingMachine.aggregatingFileChanges" was sent to stopped service "waitingMachine". This service has already reached its final state, and will not transition.
Event: {"type":"xstate.after(200)#waitingMachine.aggregatingFileChanges"}`

## Inline Code

This is an example of `inline code` written with the standard markdown backticks.

## Tables

Some tables here for testing.

| | |
|-----------------|----------------------------|
| **Class name:** | `InstallSchema`            |
| **Interface:**  | [`InstallSchemaInterface`] |
| **Method:**     | `install()`                |

Here's a table with some column headers and bigger rows.

Element | Description
--- | ---
`name` | A fully-qualified component name, in the format `<vendor-name>/<component-name>`. All letters must be in lowercase. Use dashes in the `<component-name>` to separate words. Themes must use the format `<vendor-name>/theme-<area>-<theme-name>`.
`type` | For modules, this value must be set to `magento2-module`. Other possible types are `metapackage`, `magento2-theme`, and `magento2-language`.
`autoload` | Specify necessary information to be loaded, such as [registration.php](../build/component-registration.md). For more information, see [Autoloading](https://getcomposer.org/doc/01-basic-usage.md#autoloading) from Composer.
